![I am Karen and I'm a Mobile Developer](assets/profile-header.png)

❤️ I am interested in mobile accessibility, UX, and creating visual experiences that users can enjoy.

👩🏻‍🏫 I am a mentor at work, and I regularly volunteer in STEM programs oriented towards minorities in tech. I also provide mentorship/tutoring services to individuals learning iOS development and general programming.

In my spare time, I engage in web development, learning React, Remix.js, Vue.js, Node.js, and similar technologies. Many of my repositories are related to these practices. I believe in the idea of open learning, sharing the process (including both the successes and mistakes), to gauge my personal growth. Prior to delving into the tech industry, I worked as a lawyer in Peru.

### Currently doing (April 15th, 2024)

- ActivityKit and Live Activities, using Braze.
- Prepping for a volunteering session as a Sector Partner for Unearth Education Éveillée, for high school students in West Ottawa, Ontario.
- AI as iOS developer? I am not sure how does it look like yet, but I am trying to improve in that end. So much AI around me and I still don't get much.
